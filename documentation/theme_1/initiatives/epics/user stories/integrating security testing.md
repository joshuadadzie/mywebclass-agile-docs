As a QA engineer, I want to ensure that security testing is integrated with acceptance criteria so that I can have confidence that our software meets security requirements before it is deployed. This will allow me to identify and address security vulnerabilities early in the development process, reducing the risk of data breaches and other security incidents. By having clear acceptance criteria that includes security testing, I can ensure that the development team is meeting the necessary security standards, and that we are delivering secure software to our users.
