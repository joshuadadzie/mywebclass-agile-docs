Task: Implement software monitoring for the production environment

Description:
Software monitoring is a crucial part of ensuring the stability and reliability of any software system. The following tasks should be performed:

Identify and select the appropriate monitoring tools: Select the tools that can monitor the software system effectively and efficiently. These tools should be able to track system metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, and network traffic.

Define the monitoring parameters: Identify the parameters that need to be monitored and set appropriate thresholds for each parameter. This will help in identifying any issues or anomalies in the system and take corrective actions.

Configure the monitoring tools: Configure the selected monitoring tools to collect data based on the identified parameters and thresholds.

Test the monitoring system: Test the monitoring system thoroughly to ensure that it is able to collect accurate data and generate alerts when thresholds are breached.

Integrate with alerting and notification systems: Integrate the monitoring system with alerting and notification systems to ensure that the appropriate personnel are notified in case of any issues.

Document the monitoring system: Document the monitoring system and its processes, including the tools used, parameters monitored, and thresholds set, so that it can be easily maintained and updated.

Acceptance Criteria:

The selected monitoring tools are able to track system metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, and network traffic.
The monitoring parameters are identified and appropriate thresholds are set for each parameter.
The monitoring tools are configured to collect data based on the identified parameters and thresholds.
The monitoring system is able to collect accurate data and generate alerts when thresholds are breached.
The monitoring system is integrated with alerting and notification systems.
The monitoring system and its processes are documented thoroughly.
