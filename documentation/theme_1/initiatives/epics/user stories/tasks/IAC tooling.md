Task: Set up IAC (Infrastructure as Code) tooling for the project

Description:
Infrastructure as Code (IAC) is a practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through code. This allows for more consistent and efficient infrastructure management, as well as improved collaboration between development and operations teams. In order to implement IAC in our project, we need to set up the necessary tooling.

Task Steps:

Research IAC tools: Research different IAC tools that are suitable for our project needs. Some popular IAC tools include Terraform, Ansible, and Chef.
Evaluate tooling options: Evaluate the tools researched and consider factors such as ease of use, support for different cloud providers, cost, and community support.
Select a tool: Based on the evaluation, select the IAC tool that best suits our project requirements and budget.
Install and configure the tool: Install the selected IAC tool and configure it to work with our infrastructure and cloud provider(s).
Write IAC code: Write IAC code using the chosen tool to define our infrastructure, such as servers, load balancers, and databases, as code.
Test and deploy: Test the IAC code and deploy it to our cloud infrastructure. Ensure that the infrastructure is provisioned correctly and functions as expected.
Document: Document the IAC setup and code for future reference and team collaboration.
Acceptance Criteria:

The selected IAC tool is installed and configured correctly.
The IAC code is written and provisions the infrastructure correctly.
The infrastructure is tested and functions as expected.
The IAC setup and code is documented for future reference and team collaboration.
