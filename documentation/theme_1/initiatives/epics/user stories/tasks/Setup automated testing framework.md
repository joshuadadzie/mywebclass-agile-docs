Task: Setup automated testing framework

Description: The task involves setting up an automated testing framework for the software application.

Steps:

Choose an appropriate automated testing framework based on the requirements and technology stack of the application.
Install the chosen testing framework and its dependencies.
Set up the test environment by configuring the necessary settings and creating test data.
Develop a test suite by identifying the test scenarios and creating test cases for each scenario.
Create test scripts using the chosen testing framework, and integrate them into the test suite.
Test the automated testing framework by running the test suite and verifying the test results.
Set up a continuous integration (CI) process that automatically runs the test suite whenever changes are made to the codebase.
Monitor and maintain the automated testing framework to ensure that it continues to function correctly as the application evolves.
Acceptance criteria:

The automated testing framework should be able to test all the critical functionalities of the application.
The test suite should cover all the use cases specified in the user stories.
The automated testing framework should be integrated into the CI process to ensure that all code changes are tested automatically.
The test results should be easily readable and provide a clear indication of the status of the application.
