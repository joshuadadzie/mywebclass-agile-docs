As a software developer, I want to run automated tests on my codebase so that I can identify and fix bugs quickly and ensure that my code meets the requirements of the project.

Acceptance Criteria:

The automated tests should cover all major functionalities of the software.
The tests should be easy to run and understand.
The tests should provide detailed reports on the outcome of each test run.
The tests should be integrated with the continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline of the project.
The tests should be updated as new features are added to the software.
