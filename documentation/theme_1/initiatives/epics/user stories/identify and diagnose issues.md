As a software tester, I want to identify and diagnose issues with acceptance criteria, so that I can ensure that the software meets the user's requirements and expectations.

Acceptance criteria:

The user story should clearly define the expected behavior of the software.
The acceptance criteria should be specific and measurable, so that the software can be tested against them.
The acceptance criteria should be agreed upon by the development team, product owner, and stakeholders.
The acceptance criteria should be reviewed and updated throughout the development process to ensure that they are still relevant and accurate.
Any issues or discrepancies with the acceptance criteria should be communicated and resolved in a timely manner.
Example user story:
As a software tester, I want to review the acceptance criteria for each user story, so that I can ensure that the software meets the user's requirements and expectations. When reviewing the acceptance criteria, I will check that they are specific, measurable, and agreed upon by all stakeholders. If I identify any issues or discrepancies with the acceptance criteria, I will communicate them to the product owner and development team and work with them to resolve the issues in a timely manner.
